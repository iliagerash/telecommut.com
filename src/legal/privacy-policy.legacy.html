<br/>
<h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>

<p>When you register with this web site (Telecommut.com), we ask you for personal information, such as your name, phone number, and email address. We use this information to process your requests, to communicate with you about the status of your requests, and to review and improve the service we provide to you. We may also use your email address to send you information about your account, such as newsletters to which you are subscribed during registration, as well as messages about any special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys, Telecommut.com services, account updates, services that may be of interest to you, or administrative messages regarding your account. You can manage your email list options under your account user settings.</p>

<p>By registering on or using Telecommut.com Web Site, you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to our partners and affiliates. Telecommut.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with third parties or non-affiliated companies, except as otherwise disclosed in this policy, or under the following circumstances:</p>

<p>We disclose information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to companies and individuals we employ to perform services on our behalf,</li>
    <li>if legally required to do so,</li>
    <li>to protect the rights or property of Telecommut.com or our affiliated companies, or</li>
    <li>to protect the personal safety of users or the general public.</li>
</ul><br/>

<p>In order to serve you better and more efficiently, we may also share anonymous aggregated information about users with our partners and other third parties.</p>

<p>We collect information from our users at several different points on the Site. When you register with us or apply for an external job, we ask for your email address.

<p>You should be aware that any personal information (such as email address or resumes), which you voluntarily display or distribute on Telecommut.com Web Site and on the Internet can be collected and used by others, no different than posting this information in a newspaper.
